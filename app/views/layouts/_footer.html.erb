                    You further acknowledge that the Website may contain information which

                    is designated confidential by Us and that you shall not disclose such

                  <span class="ques-ans">
                    Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of

                    your private communications and other personally identifiable information

                    will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy

                    Policy. By way of example (without limiting and foregoing), we may

                    be forced to disclose information to the government, law enforcement

                    agencies or third parties. Under certain circumstances, third parties may

                    unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or

                    members may abuse or misuse your information that they collect from our

                    Website. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect

                    your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your

                    personally identifiable information or private communications would always

                    remain private.<br/>

                    As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable

                    information about you to any third party. However, the following describes

                    some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may be

                    disclosed.<br/>

                    <strong>8.1 External Service Providers:</strong> There may be a number of services

                    offered by external service providers that help you use our Websites. If

                    you choose to use these optional services, and in the course of doing

                    so, disclose information to the external service providers, and/or grant

                    them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your

                    information is governed by their private policy.<br/>

                    <strong>8.2 Other Corporate Entities:</strong> We share much of our data, including

                    personally identifiable information about you, with our parent and/or

                    subsidiaries that are committed to serving your online needs and related

                    services, throughout the world. Such data will be shared for the sole

                    purpose of enhancing your browsing experience. To the extent that

                    these entities have access to your information, they will treat it at least as

                    protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other members.

                    It is possible that We and/or its subsidiaries, or any combination of such,

                    could merge with or be acquired by another business entity. Should such

                    a combination occur, you should expect that we would share some or all

                    of your information in order to continue to provide the service. You will

                    receive notice of such event (to the extent that it occurs).<br/>

                    <strong>8.3 Law and Order:</strong> We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as

                    well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property

                    rights, fraud and other rights. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose

                    any information about you to law enforcement and other government

                    officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate,

                    in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property

                    infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to

                    legal liability.<br/>

                  <span class="ques-ans">
                    Following registration, you can review and change the information you

                    information we may keep track of your old information. You can change

                    your registration information such as your Email ID etc.<br/>

                    To remove your profile so that others cannot view it, contact our customer

                    We will retain in our files the information you have requested to remove for

                    certain circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems

                    and enforce our terms and conditions. Further, such prior information is

                    never completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal

                    constraints, including stored 'back up' systems. Therefore, you should

                    not expect that all of your personally identifiable information would be

                    completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.

                    Except as otherwise expressly mentioned in this Privacy Policy, this

                    document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect

                    whether they are on our Websites or on other sites throughout the Internet,

                    different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you

                    disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers, they

                    adhere to their own privacy policies. Since we do not control the privacy

                    policies of the third parties, you are subject to ask questions before you

                    disclose your personal information to others. Any information that you

                    make publicly available on the site may be potentially viewed by any party,

                  <span class="ques-ans">
                    We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques 

                    to protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside

                    and outside the company. We do not recommend transfer of sensitive

                    information (such as credit card number) and bank account details via

                    the Site to any third party. Users are recommended to do so offline, on

                    the phone or via personal emails. We follow generally accepted industry

                    standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during

                    transmission and once we receive it. However, "perfect security" does

                    not exist on the Internet. You therefore agree that any security breaches

                    beyond the control of our standard security procedures are at your sole

                    risk and discretion.
